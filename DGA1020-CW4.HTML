    <h2>Vector Illustration </h2>
 
    <ul>
        <li> Experimentation was done using a vector illustration software Adobe Illustrator to recreate an illustration
             inspired <strong>Te fit-Tazza and Malta Doors.</strong></li>
        
        <li><em>The final design was inspired by one of the unique door found in the narrow streets of Imdina, Malta. 
            Its vibrant colours and symmetry give it a classical yet unique touch.</em></li>
     </ul>

<h2>Blender Experimentation </h2>

<ul>
    <li> Experimentation was done using an open source 3D Modelling program called <strong>Blender</strong>. 
        The aim was to experiment with basic sculpting tools, while using different lighting points and good
        camera perspective to render a final video.</li>
    
    <li> <em>The below render is the final design. The still life is made of some fruit and a fruit bowl.</em></li>
</ul>
